In Strategy Pattern objects are created to represent various strategies (in my example werewolf and normal form). The Strategy object is an interface that these objects implement. This strategy can then be selected on the basis of a context (in my example the phases of the moon).

I don't fully understand this no matter how much I read, but this is my understanding at the minute.
